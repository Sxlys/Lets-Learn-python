Let's Learn Python! For Dummies!
--------------------------------

Notes: General bits of useful info to remeber.
	~Comments can be denoted using #, everything after will be ignored, code-wise.
	~Python is case sensative {"ClassName" is different from "classname"}

Chapter 1;=====================================================================

	Modules;
		Little bytes (heh) of code that can accomplish various task without having to wite them from scratch. Import using "import [module name]" at the beginning of your code file

	Data types;
		~Numbers:
			Valid number types are: 1, .01, -1, 1.01
		
		~Types of Numbers:
			Integers:
				Any whole real number, positive or negative.

			Floats:
				Any number that contains a decimal point

			Complex numbers:
				Imaginary numbers, denoted by ending in "j"

			Strings:	
				Any text can be part of a string. "this is a string" you can tell because it's enclosed in quotes, either single '', or double "".
				(However if the string contains an apostrophe, the whole string should be contained within double quotes. Alternatively you can escape the apostrophe by using a backslash preceeding said apostrophe.IE: "that\'s my bike")

			Booleans:
				In python, True & False valuables get stored in variables. IE: "x = true//x=false"

		~Doing mathematical operations:
			Operators:
				All standard math operations are available in python.			+, -, *, /, **, //, %
				Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Exponents, Floor Division, Modulus(remainder after division)

			Boolean Operators:
				OR - Either "x or y" is true
				AND - Both "x and y" are true
				NOT - "Not X", x is not full
